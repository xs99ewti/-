VFI_LazyBear_Enhanced.mq5 Compilation Validation Checklist:

✅ FIXED ISSUES:

1. OnCalculate Function Signature:
   - Function signature is correct for MQL5
   - Parameters use proper types: long &tick_volume[], long &volume[]
   - Return type is int as required

2. Volume Data Type Issues:
   - Changed volume handling from double to long types
   - Added proper type casting: (double)vol_value
   - Fixed array parameter types throughout

3. Array Bounds Protection:
   - Added bounds checking: j < ArraySize(tick_volume) && j < ArraySize(volume)
   - Added current_bar bounds checking in CheckSignalsAndAlerts
   - Protected buffer access with ArraySize() checks

4. Function Declarations:
   - Added comprehensive function declarations at top of file
   - Added CopyTickVolumeData() helper function
   - All functions properly declared before use

5. Alert System Improvements:
   - Added last_alert_bar[] array for per-candle alert prevention
   - Modified SendAlert() to prevent duplicate alerts per candle
   - Enhanced spam protection

6. Signal Logic:
   - Prioritized EMA crossings over zero line crossings
   - Signals only show on VFI-EMA line crossings as requested
   - Zero line crossings only generate alerts, not signal arrows

7. Code Structure:
   - Renamed file to proper .mq5 extension
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - Enhanced bounds checking throughout

POTENTIAL REMAINING ISSUES TO MONITOR:
- Runtime array access should be monitored for edge cases
- Dynamic zone calculations need sufficient data points
- Alert system performance with high-frequency signals

COMPILATION READINESS: ✅ READY
The indicator should now compile without the three mentioned errors:
1. ✅ OnCalculate function signature corrected
2. ✅ Function exists and is properly declared
3. ✅ Volume array types corrected (long instead of int)
